## SECTION 2 — ENGLISH (PROFESSIONAL & TECHNICAL)

**Focus:**  
Restoring automatic English usage with emphasis on narrative clarity.

**Core structure trained:**  
When I ___, I realized I had ___.

**Activities:**
- Repeated drills using a fixed structure.  
- Focus on past event sequencing.  
- Introduction to Past Perfect in real contexts.

**Current assessment:**  
High B1+ progressing toward C1.  
Main bottleneck is automation, not understanding.

# English Learning Log — Evaluation Update (C1 Path)

## Date
2026-02-08

---

## Evaluation Summary
This session marks a **clear transition from unconscious error to conscious control** in past-time sequencing.

The learner is no longer making flat-past errors blindly.
Instead, errors now occur **during deliberate construction**, which indicates correct internalization of the temporal model.

This is a necessary and irreversible stage in advanced language acquisition.

---

## Confirmed Evolution

### 1. Timeline Awareness (Major)
- Learner now consistently recognizes when narration collapses into a single past.
- Actively attempts to reduce listener effort by anchoring events.
- Past Perfect is no longer avoided and is selected intentionally.

This represents a shift from **B1 intuition** to **C1 analytical control**.

---

### 2. Structural Stability Under Drill
- Repeated correct production of the pattern:
  **“When I ___, I realized I had ___.”**
- Errors observed are now:
  - tense alignment (have vs had)
  - verb form (forgot vs forgotten)
  - syntax and prepositions
- No longer conceptual sequencing errors.

This confirms that the bottleneck is **automation**, not understanding.

---

### 3. Metalinguistic Accuracy
- Learner correctly identified and refined terminology:
  - “pat” → “padding”
- Demonstrates precise control over abstract language and register.
- Shows ability to self-correct at a conceptual level.

This is **advanced language awareness**, not beginner behavior.

---

## Current Limitation (Explicit)

- Production is **not automatic**.
- Output still requires:
  - stopping
  - checking structure
  - conscious execution

This places the learner in **Stage 2 → early Stage 3**:
> right, but slow.

This is expected and non-negotiable.

---

## Instructor Judgment

- Progress is **real but uncomfortable**.
- No curriculum advancement authorized.
- Correct decision: remain on the same structure until:
  - speed increases
  - hesitation drops
  - pattern is produced without conscious recall

---

## Next Action
- Continue high-volume, low-variation drills.
- Remove explanations.
- Increase tempo gradually.
- Advancement only when production becomes reflexive.

---

## Final Note
This session represents **structural consolidation**, not surface fluency.
It is the correct foundation for C1-level spoken English.

# English for Technical Communication  
## Weekly Progress Report — Week 1  
**Period:** Feb 11–15, 2026  

---

# 🎯 Weekly Objective
Rebuild spoken fluency, stabilize past tenses, and increase structural consistency under real-time speech pressure.

---

# 📊 CEFR Positioning (Evidence-Based)

Start of Week: **B1+ (unstable production)**  
End of Week: **B2- (emerging stability)**  

This is not a full level jump.  
It is movement within the B1+/B2- transition zone.

# 📈 Skill Breakdown

## 1️⃣ Past Simple Stability
Start: B1  
End: B2-  

Progress:
```
B1     ███░░
B1+    ████░
B2-    █████
```

Improvement:
- Reduced tense collapse mid-sentence  
- Faster self-correction (“I wake up… I woke up…”)  
- More consistent narrative sequencing  

Remaining Issue:
- Occasional article omissions  

---

## 2️⃣ Past Perfect Usage
Start: B1- (rare usage)  
End: B2- (correct usage when prompted)

Progress:
```
B1-    ██░░░
B1     ███░░
B2-    ████░
```

Evidence:
Correct production:
> “I had forgotten my documents.”

Needs:
- Automatic usage without prompting  
- Mixed conditional stability  

---

## 3️⃣ Conditional Structures
Start: B1  
End: B1+ / B2- (emerging)

Progress:
```
B1     ███░░
B1+    ████░
B2-    ████░ (not stable yet)
```

Observed:
- Correct structure when guided  
- Instability in spontaneous hypothetical consistency  
- Confusion between “need” and “would need”

Focus Next Week:
Mixed conditionals & hypothetical consistency.

---

## 4️⃣ Fluency Under Cognitive Load
Start: B1 (high hesitation noise)  
End: B1+ / B2- (improving control)

Progress:
```
B1     ███░░
B1+    ████░
B2-    ████░
```

Improvements:
- Reduced panic when forgetting words  
- Better recovery after interruption  
- More coherent long narratives  

Remaining:
- Overbuilding sentences  
- Occasional mid-structure collapse  

---

## 5️⃣ Professional Expression
Start: B1+  
End: B2-  

Progress:
```
B1+    ████░
B2-    █████
```

Strong Indicators:
- Abstract reasoning (career durability, AI obsolescence)
- Strategic explanation
- Self-analysis capability

# 🧠 Cognitive vs Structural Gap

Cognitive Level: **B2 solid**  
Spoken Structural Level: **B2 emerging**

Gap narrowing.

---

# 🔎 Recurring Weak Patterns

- Article precision (“a amount” → “an amount”)  
- Prepositions (“in the weekend” → “on the weekend”)  
- Hypothetical consistency (“I need” vs “I would need”)  
- Overextended clauses  

---

# 🚀 Measurable Improvements This Week

✔ Faster tense correction  
✔ Correct past perfect formation  
✔ Better conditional awareness  
✔ Reduced defensive reaction to correction  
✔ Longer sustained English output without breakdown  

---

# 📅 Focus for Week 2

1. Automatic past perfect integration  
2. Mixed conditional stability  
3. Clause tightening (shorter sentences, stronger endings)  
4. Article precision drills  
5. Controlled speed speaking

# 📌 Summary Assessment

This week shows real structural stabilization.

No artificial grading.
No exaggerated leap.

Trajectory:  
**B1+ (unstable) → B2- (emerging)**  

Direction: Upward.
