Structural Gains

Clear hierarchy of decisions

Proper use of else as logical complement

Stable % parity testing

Reduced syntax anxiety

Weak Points

Execution order inversion (minor)

Needs repetition for automation

Previous Consolidation — Loops

Stable while mechanics

Boundary awareness (> vs >=)

Infinite loop recognition

Control variable mutation discipline

Next Step

Integrate while + if in controlled mini-system.
