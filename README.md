# Learning Portfolio

Structured documentation of my transition into software development, combining:

- Python fundamentals
- Prompt Engineering
- English (Technical Communication)
- Spanish (Professional Integration)

---

## Current Focus

### Python
Building structural foundations through:
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Nested logic
- Control flow discipline
- Mental execution simulation

Level: Early Junior — Structural consolidation phase.

---

### Prompt Engineering
Developing structured, auditable prompt systems focused on:
- Constraint control
- Output normalization

- Enterprise-level reasoning

---

### English (Technical Communication)
Current Level: B2- (emerging stability)

Focus:
- Past tense stabilization
- Conditional consistency
- Controlled fluency under cognitive load

---

### Spanish (Professional Integration)
Current Level: B1- (structural stabilization phase)

Focus:
- Pronoun order correction
- Interference reduction
- Present tense consolidation
