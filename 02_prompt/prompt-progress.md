# Final Evaluation — Case #1 (Closed)

## Scope
This evaluation reflects exactly what was delivered by the candidate, without penalizing external tooling issues.

---

## 1. What Was Effectively Built (Consolidated)

The candidate produced an **entry-level enterprise-grade prompt**, correctly structured with the following components:

### AI Role Definition
- Data aggregation and reconciliation agent  
- Non-judgmental  
- Non-opinionated  
- Non-persuasive  
- No inference beyond provided data  

✔️ Correct and clearly defined.

---

### Inputs
- Source: internal systems or spreadsheets (Excel)  
- Minimum fields vary by sector (e.g., sales, delivery, target metrics)  
- Fixed reporting period: **monthly**  
- Submission deadline: **last business day of the current month**

✔️ This resolves a common enterprise failure mode: mixed reporting periods.

---

### Operating Rules
- Cross-sector data reconciliation  
- Detection of logical and operational inconsistencies  
- Explicit prohibitions:
  - no data invention  
  - no gap filling  
- When data is missing:
  - explicitly report “insufficient data”
  - list exactly which data points are missing  
- “Responsible party” defined as the data provider  
- Output language:
  - informational  
  - non-accusatory  
  - oriented toward future correction  

✔️ At this stage, the candidate clearly surpasses beginner-level expectations.

---

### Outputs

Two output layers were implicitly but clearly defined:

#### Executive Summary (Board / Leadership)
- Sector  
- Status:
  - Consistent  
  - Inconsistent  
  - Insufficient Data  
- Short observation

#### Operational Detail (Audit / Operations)
- Sector  
- Metric  
- Reported value  
- Detected conflict (if any)  
- Missing data (if any)  
- Data provider  
- Required action (e.g., provide missing data)

✔️ Even without formal column schemas, the structure is unambiguous.

---

## 2. Final Score

**8.7 / 10**

This score reflects **strong early-stage applied capability** in enterprise prompt engineering.

---

## 3. Key Strengths Observed

- Clear understanding of **AI-blocker problems**  
- Correct separation between:
  - data  
  - responsibility  
  - judgment  
- Explicit construction of:
  - traceability  
  - governance  
  - predictable reporting cadence  
- Avoidance of a common beginner error:
  > Using AI to “decide” before the system itself is organized

This indicates a **sound engineering mindset**.

---

## 4. Cognitive Evolution Observed

Across the exercise, a clear progression was identified:

- Initial state:  
  *Unclear understanding of AI-blocker concepts*

- Intermediate state:  
  *Correct AI role definition, with partial confusion between validation and authority*

- Final state:  
  - AI defined as a neutral process  
  - Validation understood as cross-checking, not trust  
  - Responsibility assigned to data origin  
  - Errors framed as missing inputs, not human fault  

This represents **real cognitive advancement**, not superficial improvement.

---

## 5. Identified Gaps (Normal, Not Errors)

Future development areas:

1. **Formalization**
   - explicit schemas
   - keys
   - enumerated status values  

2. **Rule Encoding**
   - transforming examples into explicit validation checks  

These were **not required** for this case.

---

# Progression Signal — Across Cases (v1)

This section captures **cross-case cognitive progression**, not individual case performance.  
It evaluates how prompt design strategy adapts to different problem types over time.

---

## Observed Progression (Case #1 → Case #2)

### Shift in Problem Framing
- **Case #1** focused on *system organization before AI decision-making*:
  - structuring inputs
  - enforcing data governance
  - preventing premature inference
- **Case #2** focused on *controlling AI behavior after deployment*:
  - stabilizing outputs
  - enforcing determinism
  - managing ambiguity and execution variance

This demonstrates a correct transition from **structural readiness** to **behavioral reliability**.

---

### Abstraction Calibration
- In **Case #1**, moderate abstraction was appropriate to:
  - define roles
  - separate responsibility from judgment
  - establish governance boundaries
- In **Case #2**, abstraction was intentionally reduced to:
  - prioritize determinism
  - preserve comparability between executions
  - constrain creative variance

The candidate correctly adjusted abstraction level **based on problem requirements**, not personal preference.

---

### Evolution in Prompt Control Strategy
Across the two cases, a clear refinement is observable:
- From:
  - descriptive constraints
  - example-driven reasoning
- Toward:
  - rule-based containment
  - explicit execution stops
  - structural consistency requirements

This indicates movement from **conceptual understanding** toward **operational engineering**.

---

### Maturity Signal
The progression suggests early but meaningful development in:
- recognizing AI failure modes
- choosing restriction over expressiveness when reliability is critical
- treating prompts as **system control mechanisms**, not communication artifacts

This evolution is **directionally correct** for enterprise prompt engineering contexts.

---

## Summary Assessment

Across Case #1 and Case #2, the candidate demonstrates:
- increasing alignment between problem type and prompt strategy
- improved discipline in constraining AI behavior
- reduced reliance on philosophical framing in favor of executable structure

This progression reflects **growing engineering maturity**, not merely isolated task completion.

# Learning Log — Case #3 (Closed)

## Case Title
Multi-Criteria Capital Allocation Model — Structured Scoring & Risk Normalization

## Context
Enterprise environment with competing internal projects across departments.  
Objective: normalize evaluation criteria, eliminate bias, and create a transparent, replicable scoring model without delegating decision-making authority to AI.

The AI acts strictly as:
- Structural evaluator
- Data normalizer
- Score calculator
- Sensitivity simulator

Final approval remains human.

---

## Core Objective

Design a weighted, auditable scoring framework incorporating:

- Financial return
- Regulatory exposure
- Execution complexity
- Strategic alignment

All variables must be:
- Measurable
- Normalized
- Transparent
- Reproducible

No invented inputs.
No implicit assumptions.

---

## Model Architecture

### Fixed Weights (Sum = 1.0)

- Financial = 0.40  
- Regulatory = 0.25  
- Complexity = 0.25  
- Strategy = 0.10  

---

### Financial Index

Inputs:
- ROI
- Payback (months)

Formulation:
- Payback_inverse = 1 / Payback_months
- Financial_Index = (0.70 × ROI_norm) + (0.30 × Payback_inverse_norm)

Insight:
Shorter capital return reduces exposure risk and increases score robustness.

---

### Regulatory Index

Subcomponents:
- Historical_Fine_Risk
- Government_Interaction_Exposure (1–5)
- Sector_Legal_Instability (1–5)

Base:
Regulatory_Index = mean(normalized subcomponents)

Exposure Adjustment:
Exposure_Adjustment = 1 + norm(Payback_months)

Final:
Regulatory_Final = Regulatory_Index × Exposure_Adjustment

Converted to positive contribution:
Regulatory_Adjusted = 1 - norm(Regulatory_Final)

Key Learning:
Institutional friction must be modeled as measurable exposure, not abstract narrative.

---

### Complexity Index

Subcomponents:
- CAPEX_incremental_%
- Tech_Dependency (1–5)
- Team_Expansion_Ratio

Complexity_Index = mean(normalized subcomponents)
Complexity_Adjusted = 1 - Complexity_Index

Key Learning:
Execution burden must remain structurally separated from regulatory risk.

---

### Strategic Index

Input:
- Strategic_Alignment (1–5)

Strategic_Index = normalized value

---

### Final Score

Score =
(Wf × Financial_Index) +
(Wr × Regulatory_Adjusted) +
(Wc × Complexity_Adjusted) +
(Ws × Strategic_Index)

Ranking:
Descending by Score.

Tie-break order:
1. Higher Financial_Index
2. Higher Regulatory_Adjusted
3. Higher Complexity_Adjusted
4. Higher Strategic_Index

---

### Sensitivity Analysis

- Recalculate ROI under adjusted interest rate scenarios.
- Recompute Financial_Index.
- Recompute Score.
- Observe ranking stability.

Weights remain fixed.
Only variables change.

---

## Major Conceptual Breakthrough

Separation of:

- Empirical experience
- Political/institutional friction
- Measurable variables
- Model structure integrity

Learning Outcome:
Never distort an existing measurable index to accommodate an intangible phenomenon.
Create a new measurable proxy instead.
