# Spanish for Professional Integration  
## Weekly Progress Report — Week 1  
**Period:** Feb 11–15, 2026  

---

## Weekly Objective  

Establish a solid structural base in oral production, reduce Portuguese interference, and stabilize B1-level sentence construction.

---

## CEFR Positioning (Evidence-Based)

**Start of Week:** A2 High (structural interference present)  
**End of Week:** B1- (emerging structural control)

No artificial level inflation.  
No exaggerated leap.

Progress is structural, not superficial.
